# liri-node-app

LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters for songs, bands, and movies and returns relavent data.

This app makes calls to the:

- Node-Spotify-API
- Axios
  - Axios was used to grab data from the OMDB API and the Bands In Town API
- Moment
- DotEnv

When runing this app in you command line, you may use the following to find your desired data:

    - "spotify-this-song"
    - "concert-this"
    - "movie-this"
    - "do-what-it-says".

There is a file named <b> Liri Bot Screen Shots </b> that you can view how the app looks when it is working.
